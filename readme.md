# 30 Days 30 JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the **30 Days 30 JavaScript Projects** repository! This project is a collection of fun and practical JavaScript-based projects that I am building over the span of 30 days. The goal is to improve my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS while creating useful and engaging mini-projects.
